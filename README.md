# **Task 4 â€“ CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins**

### **Objective**

Create a CI/CD pipeline for the Spring Boot application (from Task #1) using **Jenkins**.The pipeline automates:

1.  Building the project (Maven build- to create jar file)
    
2.  Creating and pushing Docker images to DockerHub

### ðŸ§© **Tools & Technologies Used**

*   **Jenkins** (for CI/CD automation)
    
*   **Maven** (for Java project build)
    
*   **Docker** (for containerization)
    
*   **GitHub** (for version control)
    
*   **DockerHub** (for image repository)

### **Jenkins Setup**

#### **Jenkins Installation**

Installed Jenkins on my **Windows machine** using the .msi installer.

*   During setup, Jenkins runs by default on port 8080.
    
*   Configured Jenkins to run on a different port (8099) to avoid conflicts with the application.

### **Pipeline Flow**

1.  **Code Checkout** â€“ Jenkins clones the GitHub repository.
    
2.  **Build Stage** â€“ Maven compiles and packages the application into a .jar.
    
3.  **Docker Build Stage** â€“ Builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile.
    
4.  **Docker Push Stage** â€“ Pushes the built image to DockerHub.
    
5.  **Cleanup Stage** â€“ Removes temporary Docker files to save space.
